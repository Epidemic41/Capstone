Abstract:
Problem: Organizations need an automated tool that can ensure Windows workstations are compliant with security standards.

Project Description:
  What:
    Shell Fortress monitors security configurations to meet a security baseline. These are completed via scans and the results are stored in the form of reports. These reports can be accessed from a dashboard.

  Why:

  Who:
    Stakeholders include Legal, IT, and Public Relations Departments.
    
Process:
  During the planning phase, Waterfall method was used. For the building phase, the Agile method was used for continuous updating, improvement, and debugging.

Features:
  Measures security compliance
  Collects machine security configuration
  Compares current security configuration to baseline
  Generates PDF Report
  Report Downloadable from dashboard

Lessons Learned:
  Technological proof of concepts are critical to project success
  Leave buffer time in project plans to account for roadblocks
  Use the tool thatâ€™s right for the job

Technologies:
  Flask
  Python
  Powershell
  MongoDB

Future Work:
  Expand to Windows Server and Ubuntu Operating Systems
  Reconfigure hosts remotely
